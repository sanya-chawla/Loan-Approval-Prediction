# Loan-Approval-Prediction

The project aims to predict which coustomers are getting their loan approved. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and 
Naive Bayes Algorithm was applied on the supervised classification problem.

Data visualization was performed in order to make inferences from the data and it has been seen that the loan has been approved for more than 65% of the 
applicants.

ROC curves were plotted for the four algorithms and based on accuracy and ROC curve, Logistic Regression was concluded to be the preferred algorithm among 
the four algorithms applied.
